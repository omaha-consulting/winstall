# winstall

## A web app for browsing Windows Package Manager apps, and create a batch-installation command using an intuitive interface.  

How does it work?
-----------------------

winstall is powered by Windows Package Manager (aka "winget"), [Microsoft's new package manager](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-package-manager-preview/) for Windows 10 and 11. it is available by default in Windows 10 and 11.

Installing Windows Package Manager
----------------------------------

If you don't already have Windows Package Manager, you can install it by downloading and installing the [latest .appxbundle file from here.](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases)

Using winstall
--------------

To use winstall, you can search for apps on the homepage. Additionally, you can also view all the apps available via Windows Package Manager [on this page.](https://winstall.app//apps)

Simply select the apps you want to download and click on the "Generate Script" button at the bottom of the screen. You will then be presented with a command that you can copy and paste into any Windows command-line. Input that into a command line app of your choice, and hit enter to start installing the apps one-by-one using Windows Package Manager. You can also generate a PowerShell script by toggling the "Show Powershell scirpt" option.

Alternatively, you can click on the "Download .bat/.ps1" button which will download a batch file. However, you will likely get a security warning from your browser. In that case, ignore the warning as the batch file is completely secure. Once downloaded, you can double-click the .bat/ file to install the apps using the Windows Package Manager.

How is the data obtained?
-------------------------

winstall is powered by an API that I have built. The API regularly checks Microsoft's [official repository](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) for Windows Package Manager apps. This means it always provides the latest data.

The API updates its data every 15 minutes on weekdays, and every 3 hours on weekends. I will be making the API open-source in the near-future.

Popular apps
------------

The list of popular apps are fetched from a `.json` file with a pre-populated set of data. On the front-end, a random selection of 6 apps from the list is displayed. If you would like to add an app to the list of popular apps, you can do so by [adding an app here](https://github.com/omaha-consulting/winstall/blob/master/data/popularApps.json) and creating a pull request. You will also have to provide a logo for that app, which needs to have a transparent image, be 80x80px, and in the .webp format. The logo must be [added in this folder.](https://github.com/omaha-consulting/winstall/tree/master/public/assets/apps). And because Safari does not like .webp, you need to also add a .png version of the same image under /apps/fallback.

History

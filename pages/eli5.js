          <h2>Installing Windows Package Manager</h2>
          <p>
            If you don't already have Windows Package Manager, you can install
            it by downloading and installing the{" "}
            <a
              href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases"

          <h2>Using winstall</h2>
          <p>
            To use winstall, you can search for apps on the homepage.
            Additionally, you can also view all the apps available via Windows
            Package Manager{" "}
            <Link href="/apps">
              <a>on this page.</a>
            </Link>
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply select the apps you want to download and click on the
            "Generate Script" button at the bottom of the screen. You will then
            be presented with a command that you can copy and paste into any
            Windows command-line. Input that into a command line app of your
            choice, and hit enter to start installing the apps one-by-one using
            Windows Package Manager. You can also generate a PowerShell script by toggling
            the "Show Powershell script" option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, you can click on the "Download .bat/.ps1" button which
            will download a batch file. However, you will likely get a security
            warning from your browser. In that case, ignore the warning as the
            batch file is completely secure. Once downloaded, you can
            double-click the .bat/ file to install the apps using the Windows
            Package Manager.

          <h2>How is the data obtained?</h2>
          <p>
            winstall is powered by an API that I have built. The API regularly checks Microsoft's {" "}

            for Windows Package Manager apps. This means it always provides the latest data.
          </p>
          <p>The API updates its data every 15 minutes on weekdays, and every 3 hours on weekends. I will be making the API open-source in the near-future.</p>
